        Kryptic Sound is not an artist or company. It is built to be a
        collective of artists from all types of mediums. Painters and visual
        artists, musicians and lyricists, glass blowers, clothing makers, and
        other artisans of the like. The purpose of Kryptic Sound is to build a
        community and a marketspace for freethinkers to share their work and
        elevate one another in life.
