Hello Everyone :) <br>
My name is Thomas O'Reilly and I am one of the founding members of Kryptic Sound. I was born and raised in the Bass Capital of the South #ATL HOE with my 6 year old black lab, and wear many hats within our collective. I currently work for an Event Technology company called Event Farm and leverage our Tech to create brand awareness, promote future events, and drive engagement for big brands like Nike, Jordan, and the NBA, which I plan on incorporating into some future Kryptic Sounds Events! I'm a giant grizzly bear, and Basshead at heart so if there is anything I can ever do to help you out just let me know!
