My name is Amron Forsythe, I am a 25 year old from Tennessee. Day by day, I dabble in custom merch design and production, but my main gig is photography! From portrait to landscape, my camera is with me at all times, but event photography is the epitome of my happiness. I have shot shows for artists such as Rest in Pierce, VCTRE, Thriftworks, as well as working hand-in-hand with Sacred Hive Collective. I feel as thought my arts are heavily influenced by Bassnectar, Mersiv, and G Jones. I want to share the love and light Iâ€™ve experienced in the community with all of you through art.
