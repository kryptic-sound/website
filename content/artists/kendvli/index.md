Hi I’m Jake. I’m an Audio Engineer and artist out of Nashville. I produce hiphop and lofi / downtempo electronic. I founded Kryptic Sound along with 5 of my bestfriends. My vision was to break the mold in the music industry and art scene. To create an all inclusive space and community where artists can collaborate while also building their own brand and can keep their individuality.
